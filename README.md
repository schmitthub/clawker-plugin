# Clawker Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that acts as a clawker internals expert — helping you set up, configure, and troubleshoot [clawker](https://github.com/schmitthub/clawker) environments.

This repository is both the plugin and its marketplace: the `clawker-support` plugin lives at the repo root and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` serves it directly.

## What it does

When you invoke `/clawker-support`, Claude becomes a clawker configuration specialist that:

- **Researches** what you're trying to add (packages, MCP servers, tools, runtimes)
- **Reads** the actual Dockerfile templates and config schema to understand how clawker works
- **Synthesizes** the exact YAML config you need, with firewall rules and all

It understands the full clawker system: Dockerfile generation, config layering, firewall architecture, injection points, build-time vs runtime, and common gotchas.

## Install

```bash
# Install with the clawker CLI (recommended)
clawker skill install
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add schmitthub/clawker-plugin

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install clawker-support@schmitthub-plugins
```

## Usage

In any Claude Code session:

```
/clawker-support how do I add the GitHub MCP to my container?
```

```
/clawker-support my container can't reach pypi.org
```

```
/clawker-support help me set up a Rust project with clawker
```

Or just ask about clawker — the skill triggers automatically when it detects clawker-related questions.
